                                        Being and inquisitive person and who believe their are
                                        rooms for self development and self dream actualization,
                                        programming as being a my new adventure for a while now.
                                        I am a Backend Developer in this training and my aim is to be
                                        able to flourish as a fullstack developer.

                                        
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                        I have heard a lot about HNGi8 such as how tasking 
                                        and demanding the training can be. I believe for every
                                        success story their must be a price to be paid. Which I am
                                        willing to pay on my own part and believe all things will 
                                        work together for my good.
